	first cast an AMoD system into a closed, multi-class BCMP queueing
	network model. Second, we present analysis tools that allow the characterization
	of performance metrics for a given routing policy, in terms, e.g.,
	of vehicle availabilities and second-order moments of vehicle throughput.
	Third, we propose a scalable method for the synthesis of routing
	policies, with performance guarantees in the limit of large fleet
	sizes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on a case study
	of New York City. Collectively, this paper provides a unifying framework
	for the analysis and control of AMoD systems, which subsumes earlier
	Jackson and flow network models, provides a quite large set of modeling
	options (e.g., the inclusion of road capacities and general travel
	time distributions), and allows the analysis of second and higher-order

	to optimize vehicle scheduling and routing in an autonomous mobility-on-demand
	(AMoD) system. In AMoD systems, robotic, self-driving vehicles transport
	customers within an urban environment and are coordinated to optimize
	service throughout the entire network. Specifically, we first propose
	a novel discrete-time model of an AMoD system and we show that this
	formulation allows the easy integration of a number of real-world
	constraints, e.g., electric vehicle charging constraints. Second,
	leveraging our model, we design a model predictive control algorithm
	for the optimal coordination of an AMoD system and prove its stability
	in the sense of Lyapunov. At each optimization step, the vehicle
	scheduling and routing problem is solved as a mixed integer linear
	program (MILP) where the decision variables are binary variables
	representing whether a vehicle will 1) wait at a station, 2) service
	a customer, or 3) rebalance to another station. Finally, by using
	real-world data, we show that the MPC algorithm can be run in real-time
	for moderately-sized systems and outperforms previous control strategies
	for AMoD systems.},

	fleet of autonomous (i.e., self-driving) vehicles providing on-demand
	mobility within a capacitated transportation network, where congestion
	might disrupt throughput. We model the problem within a network flow
	framework and show that under relatively mild assumptions the rebalancing
	vehicles, if properly coordinated, do not lead to an increase in
	congestion (in stark contrast to common belief). From an algorithmic
	standpoint, such theoretical insight suggests that the problem of
	routing customers and rebalancing vehicles can be decoupled, which
	leads to a computationally-efficient routing and rebalancing algorithm
	for the autonomous vehicles. Numerical experiments and case studies
	corroborate our theoretical insights and show that the proposed algorithm
	outperforms state-of-the-art point-to-point methods by avoiding excess
	congestion on the road. Collectively, this paper provides a rigorous
	approach to the problem of congestion-aware, system-wide coordination
	of autonomously driving vehicles, and to the characterization of
	the sustainability of such robotic systems.},

  abstract  = {In this paper we present and analyze a queueing-theoretical model
	for autonomous mobility-on-demand (MOD) systems where robotic, self-driving
	vehicles transport customers within an urban environment and rebalance
	themselves to ensure acceptable quality of service throughout the
	entire network. We cast an autonomous MOD system within a closed
	Jackson network model with passenger loss. It is shown that an optimal
	rebalancing algorithm minimizing the number of (autonomously) rebalancing
	vehicles and keeping vehicles availabilities balanced throughout
	the network can be found by solving a linear program. The theoretical
	insights are used to design a robust, real-time rebalancing algorithm,
	which is applied to a case study of New York City. The case study
	shows that the current taxi demand in Manhattan can be met with about
	8,000 robotic vehicles (roughly 60\% of the size of the current taxi
	fleet). Finally, we extend our queueing-theoretical setup to include
	congestion effects, and we study the impact of autonomously rebalancing
	vehicles on overall congestion. Collectively, this paper provides
	a rigorous approach to the problem of system-wide coordination of
	autonomously driving vehicles, and provides one of the first characterizations
	of the sustainability benefits of robotic transportation networks.},
