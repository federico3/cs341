## What is the problem/question your team is solving? 
_Give a brief but precise description or definition of the problem or question_

- rewrite that but similar

Personal mobility in the form of privately owned automobiles contributes to in- creasing levels of traffic congestion, pollution, and under-utilization of vehicles (on average 5% in the US [17]) – clearly unsustainable trends for the future. The pressing need to reverse these trends has spurred the creation of cost competitive, on-demand personal mobility solutions such as car-sharing (e.g. Car2Go, ZipCar) and ride-sharing (e.g. Uber, Lyft). However, without proper fleet management, car-sharing and, to some extent, ride-sharing systems lead to vehicle imbalances: vehicles aggregate in some areas while becoming depleted in others, due to the asymmetry between trip origins and destinations [24]. This issue has been addressed in a variety of ways in the literature. For example, in the context of bike-sharing, [5] proposes rearranging the stock of bicycles between stations using trucks. The works in [18], [4], and [1] investigate using paid drivers to move vehicles between car-sharing stations where cars are parked, while [2] studies the merits of dynamic pricing for incentivizing drivers to move to underserved areas.

- The models of RSS, ICRA and dynamic pricing models such as [banerjee] provide reactive methods to rebalancing supply, that is they react to the current conditions of the system. Less explored is the idea of preemptively predict mobility demand and act upon it. 


## What data will you use? 
_Why is the data you plan to use appropriate? Does it have the right labels/information?
It is ok to use your own data_

- We will use DiDi's trip dataset to devise and test a predictive model. 

- DiDi's dataset contains trip, traffic, locational and weather information that will serve as predictive features for the model. Originally intended for the specific task of predicting the mismatch of supply and demand, the dataset is a good option for our purposes.

## How will you solve the problem? What is your plan of action? 
_Describe and think about your approach!
What method, algorithm, technique? How will you scale it up?_

- 

## How will you evaluate your method? 
_How will you measure performance or success of your method? What baselines will you use?_

## What do you expect to submit/accomplish by the end of the quarter?
